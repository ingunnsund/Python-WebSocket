# Python-WebSocket    [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/ingunnsund/Python-WebSocket.svg?token=ZxxpdBJahNzv1GsguPxE&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ingunnsund/Python-WebSocket)

A Python WebSocket library


## Features
- Supports handshake
- Multiple clients with threads
- Supports messages in text or binary (with fragmented frames if message length is large enough)
- Ping and Pong
- Close with status and reason
- Timeout 

### Future Implementation
- WSS (WebSocket Secure)
- Allow extensions, which will add capabilities to the base protocol
- Fragmented frames for sending a message that is of unknown size without having to buffer the message
  - Fragmented frames for multiplexing is implemented

## Installation
#### Clone code from github
```
git clone https://github.com/ingunnsund/Python-WebSocket
```

After clone is completed the library can be used like the [example code](example) or see [Usage section](https://github.com/ingunnsund/Python-WebSocket#usage)

## Usage
This library is made easy like a interface that is only needed to be extended by the user of the library.
It can be done like this:
```python
class WebSocketExample(WebSocket):
```
There are some methods that needs to be overrided:
```python
def on_connection(self, new_client):

def on_error(self):

def on_message(self, new_message, sender):

def on_close(self, client_closed):
```

For example with chat see [code example](example)
